Space Invaders


The plan is to have a small ship fighting off other ships with 3 lives and eachtime the player presses a button they fire off one little missile to destroy the alien ships, the alien ships will also fire off missiles and if the player cannot dodge they take one hit of damage. 

I want to have different alien ships that fire off a different amount of projectiles instead of just one, I also want to allow the player to heal off of little health packs that float in space

Win conditions could include holding out until a time limit is reached or defeating a specific enemy at the end of the level


Space Invaders - canvas space invaders clone. Press start to play. Player has X amount of time to shoot down as many invaders as possible. Every invader shot adds points. PLayer has health, that goes down when they get hit. If they survive X amount of time or shoot all enemies, they win. IF they die they lose. after game, press replay/new game button etc.
	Stretch Goals - enemies shoot at you. larger enemy that drops health regeneration powerup. Invincibility powerup. faster fire rate powerup. different shapes for player and enemies.
