Space Invaders


The plan is to have a small ship fighting off other ships with 3 lives and eachtime the player presses a button they fire off one little missile to destroy the alien ships, the alien ships will also fire off missiles and if the player cannot dodge they take one hit of damage. 

I want to have different alien ships that fire off a different amount of projectiles instead of just one, I also want to allow the player to heal off of little health packs that float in space
